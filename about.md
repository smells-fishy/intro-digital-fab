<h1 id = "aboutTitle"> Welcome to my Webpage for PHYS-S12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication </h1>

#### _About Me_

Hi, I'm Tony! I really enjoy building things, even though I'm a slow worker and I'm not that great at it. I've mostly practiced mechanical engineering in my experiences building, as I've built hovercrafts and Rube Goldberg machines for my school's Science Olympiad team. My two favorite building materials are plywood and duct tape, but I'm looking to expand my horizons in this class.

#### _Why Fabrication?_

Looking into the future, I'm interested in the integration of mechanical mimicry of biological systems into medicine and medical engineering. I believe that nanomachines can provide huge insights into the advancement of medicine and can eliminate, or at least alleviate, the majority of human suffering due to disease on Earth.
