<p>Today, one of the Prusa printers had been giving us issues. Due to the necessicity for a late-night print and a runout of PLA, I attempted a print using PETG, which is a different type of filament than the usual PLA that we use.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when autoloading the PETG, the filament was not able to extrude past a certain point. Furthermore, the filament came out very short upon unloading, which meant that it was time to do some maintenance and remove the filament from the Teflon guide tube manually.</p>

<p>The first step was to loosen the side screw that allows a panel to rise, which will expose the extruder stepper motors. This can help troubleshoot the root of the issue.</p>
