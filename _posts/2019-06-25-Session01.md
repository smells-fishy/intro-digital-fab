### Header 3

My preliminary idea for a final project in this class is to construct a kinetic sculpture that exhibits biological properties (i.e. phototaxis) and moves/responds to stimuli "organically." This is inspired by an organic sculpture that I saw at Indiana University in Bloomington, but with the twist of motion. The structure of the sculpture is inspired by a video game that I once played. I think that this project will be a challenge to pursue and also be something that I would personally enjoy creating, as well as being a decoration that would impress the guests and bring a dream to life.
