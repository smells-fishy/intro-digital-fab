### **Ideas for a Final Project**

My preliminary idea for a final project in this class is to construct a kinetic sculpture that exhibits biological properties (i.e. phototaxis) and moves/responds to stimuli "organically." This is inspired by an organic sculpture that I saw at Indiana University in Bloomington, but with the twist of motion. The structure of the sculpture is inspired by a video game that I once played. I think that this project will be a challenge to pursue and also be something that I would personally enjoy creating, as well as being a decoration that would impress the guests and bring a dream to life.

### **How I Plan to Execute My Concept**

The sculpture will most likely be controlled by light sensors (or sensors for any other type of stimulus, i.e. pressure, electricity), and move with the assistance of motors. Although I would like to find a more elegant way of manipulating the motion of my sculpture that doesn't involve the clunky motion and noise of motors, nothing has come to mind. The phototaxis will arise from the motion of one side of the spinning disks to face the light source (_positive_ phototaxis) or to face away from said light source (_negative_ phototaxis). I also want to make the sculpture capable of moving the disk apparatus toward the light source, most likely through the use of micro-scale pistons or through a motor-powered elevator. The kinetic component of the sculpture will be mounted on a mobile platform independent of the base in order to enable motion of the entire sculpture base toward the light source. The combined motion of the disks and the mobile component toward the light source will closely approximate the action of phototaxis in plants.
