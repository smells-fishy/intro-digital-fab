<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 29)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>For my output device, I made the ultimate tool for curing heat exhaustion in the blazingly hot Massachusetts desert known as Cambridge.</p>

<p>I initially was looking for random spare parts when Jonathan found a large Intel computer fan with a cool looking heat sink on the back. He handed it over to me and I immediately saw the potential for me to cure my heat-related distress.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to figure out what each of the wires on the 4-pin connector did, especially considering that the wire colors were black, yellow, blue, and green. The most important wires to locate were the ground and the high voltage wires so I could run the fan and find out what the other wires did. This was accomplished through trial and error. Unfortunately, there is a slight delay between the application of a voltage and the spinning of the fan, which set back progress. After multiple failures, I discovered that the black wire was ground (as usual), and yellow was the 12V power.</p>

<p>Based on my knowledge on the operation of computer fans, I concluded that the blue and green wires had to be signal and speed input. In order to test this, I made a quick debugging code with Arduino that can be downloaded <a href = "fan_test.ino" download>here</a>.</p>

<img src="fancode.png" alt="The debugging code" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

<p>I got lucky and found out that the green was the output on my first try, which meant that the blue was the speed input. This was corroborated by the serial monitor output from A0 and the speed change from changing the speed input from 255 to 1 through PWM pin 6.</p>

<p>The next step was to add some speed control into the circuit. I immediately thought of the potentiometer because it most closely approximates the knob-style speed control on the fans we have in our dorms. I opted to wire the potentiometer to the 5V, A1, and ground in order to keep the two branches of the circuit separate and to prevent the resistance of the potentiometer from interfering with the operation of the fan.</p>

<p>In order to properly connect the analog input from the potentiometer to the analog output of the PWM, I had to make use of Arduino's very helpful <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map()</span> function. This function has the syntax <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map(variable, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh)</span>, which is very convenient for scaling down/up variables with large ranges (such as the analog inputs and outputs). I used <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map(input, 0, 1023, 0, 255)</span> in order to transform the 1023 possible values from the potentiometer input into 255 possible values for the PWM analog output.</p>

<p>Below, you can see my code. As you can see, it's relatively simple but provides large-range functionality and control. The code is downloadable <a href="fan.ino" download>here</a>.</p>

<p>Below, you can see the potentiometer speed control in action. It's hard to see the speed change, but it's visible if you look closely.</p>

<p>Next, I worked to design a casing for the fan in Fusion 360. I found that the best way to produce these components was through a combination of 3D printing and subtractive manufacturing. I developed two STL files with gratings and connectors in order to hold the fan together.</p>

<p>I used the Ultimaker Cura slicer utility in order to create my gcode files for printing and got a 6 hour 39 minute and 8 hour print time, so I had to do some overnight work. I checked on the print in progress in the side room at 9:00 PM Tuesday and it was going well.</p>

<img src="print.jpg" alt="The print" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

<p>The next morning, I went to the lab to finish up the fan. The first thing that I did was check if the 3D printed pieces fit together well or not. I found out that the poles were too large for the holes, so I used a 21/64 inch drill bit to slightly widen the holes from 0.32 to 0.325 to accomodate for the poles.</p>

<p>Next, I assembled the initial structure by placing the fan into the front structure (the one with the poles) and made sure everything fit nicely. I got a really tight fit, so I decided to proceed to soldering.</p>

<img src="init.jpg" alt="The print" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

<p>In order to make the fan more compact, I decided to use an Arduino nano for the main board. I had soldered the pins to the board on the day prior, and now I was going to solder the wires from the fan and potentiometer to the pins.</p>

<p>I started by clipping off roughly half of the wire on the fans. Then, I twisted together the loose ends for ease of soldering. For the potentiometer, I used 24-gauge wires and soldered them directly onto the potentiometer. Lastly, I soldered the wires to the on-board pins, making sure to <del>breathe in as much of the</del> avoid the fumes as much as possible.</p>

<p>Now that the electronics assembly was completed, I could put together the final product. I used a large amount of hot glue to join the back piece and the front piece, and then mounted the potentiometer to the back piece using hot glue as well.</p>

<p>Next, I had to upload the code to the Arduino Nano (Spoiler alert: this did not work). Initially, I tried uploading and then realized my board was set to the Arduino Uno.</p>

<p>I changed my board to the Arduino Nano and then tried again, but I got this error:</p>

<img src="fail.png" alt="Model 1" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>I tried to change the processor to the ATMega328P Old Bootloader, but this didn't work. I also tried to change the programmer, but this also had no effect on the uploading process.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, Lana popped into the room <i>right before class</i> and her Mac is able to upload to the Nano board. My fan is now humming away happily.</p>
