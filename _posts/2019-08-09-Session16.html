<h3>The Harvard Yard Model</h3>

<p>The model of Harvard Yard is probably my pride and joy. I have spend hours upon hours (possibly a few days) working on modeling the buildings as accurately and with as much detail as possible. This particular model is 10 cm in diameter when circumscribed and had a scale of roughly 1:2200 (based on the scale of the Memorial Church).</p>

<p>The STL file is shown below. I may or may not be looking to potentially commercialize this so there is no STL file available here for download, but perhaps I can be persuaded into giving you a copy.</p>

<p>In real life, the print is able to resolve many of the minute details that I have added. It is able to resolve down to roughly a half to three-quarters of a millimeter, after which it starts failing to resolve detail. The print was executed using 0.1mm layer thickness and 20% infill.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the print is able to resolve even at much, much lower scale. Even at a 1/5 scale of the tiny model (or a roughly 1:11000 model of the yard), many little details are able to be seen, as you can see below.
