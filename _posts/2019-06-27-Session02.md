### Lab 1 (June 26)

During my first lab, I explored Arduino boards (as well as the Arduino programming language) and protoboard circuitry. At first, I started with a simple circuit to light a red LED using an Arduino board as a power source and a 100 ohm resistor. Initially, the circuit appeared to be dysfunctional, but upon re-examination it was discovered that the LED used was in fact an IR LED, resulting in an output in the non-visible infrared region. Once a red LED was connected, the LED visibly emitted light, indicating that the circuit was functional. I attempted to test the maximum voltage the LED could take by removing the resistor from the circuit, but upon reconnection, the LED burned out.

After exploring circuits, I attempted to manipulate the LED output using the Arduino programming language. Initially, I explored the "Blink" example packaged in the Arduino IDE, which causes an LED to alternate on/off cycles every second. I was able to manipulate the code to cause a single LED to blink ten times a second.

I continued to experiment with the code, moving on to making multiple lights blink simultaneously. I initially ran into issues involving the delay() function causing interrupts in the main loop in the Arduino code.

My initial attempt at a program. The delays delay each other, and the two code blocks do not run simultaneously.

Attempts to run multiple void loop() simultaneously failed due to the Uno's single core being incapable of running multiple functions at once. However, after some experimentation and some inspiration from StackExchange and the Arduino Forums, I developed this program:
