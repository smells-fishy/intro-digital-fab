<h3>Moveable Fan: a Motorized Invention for Laziness</h3>

<p>For my final project, I made a motorized fan that can be controlled by remote. Although the final product ended up being more of a proof of concept than a functioning unit, it is still significant.</p>

<p>The remote consisted of a d-pad directional control system mediated by pushbuttons and an up/down speed modulation system that was similarly run via pushbutton. I had a case for the remote that was 3D printed, however this was not implemented because the silicone buttons were not cast yet. However, the silicone D-pad did work sucessfully and was an effective proof of concept.</p>

<p>The car consisted of an Intel Desktop fan converted into a desk fan function mounted on a 3D printed fan chassis. The vehicle is driven by two DC motors geared down to reduce speed and powered from 12V wall supply through an Arduino. Unfortunately, in the final product, one axle was accidentally superglued to the chassis, so there was a significant loss of functionality. However, the drive train and the fan have both worked at separate points in time, which demonstrates that they should be theoretically functional with one another.</p>
