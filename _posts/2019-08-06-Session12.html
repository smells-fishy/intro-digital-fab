<h4 style="color:orange">The fan: an episodic journey</h4>

<p>This page is dedicated to my final project, both progress and setbacks. Initially, I had the idea to make a kinetic sculpture for my final project, but I have since changed it to be a fan that has a remote control for both speed and also movement (wow!).</p>

<p>Previously, I made a prototype for my kinetic sculpture using two DC motors that allowed for rotational motion along a common axis. This can be found <a href=".../03">here</a>. I won't copy it over here because I want to focus on my true final project on this page.</p>

<p>The first step on my path toward the fan was to make a working fan apparatus. I was initially inspired to do this due to a certain fire in Thayer Hall and the following sequence of bad weather events which resulted in my room being approximately 100 times hotter than it usually is.</p>

<p>My mini fan is constructed using an Intel computer fan, a 12V power supply, Arduino boards, wires, solder, some pin/socket wires, love, and kisses. Listed below are the times that I worked on my project and the progress that I made during those sessions.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 29), Tuesday Morning (July 30)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>The first step was to consider how to make the fan. At first, I had the idea to make the fan components from a 3D-printed blade assembly and a brushless DC motor, but Jonathan found a 12V Intel desktop fan, which I couldn't resist using.</p>

<p>The computer fan had very strange wire coloring standards (black, yellow, green, blue?), so I had to figure out what each wire did. The first step was to find out which wire was 12V and which wire was ground. This was done through the process of trial and error using a power supply. Unfortunately, the fan takes some time to "uptake" the voltage from the power supply and start spinning, so this returned false negatives that set back progress a bit. After many iterations, I found that the black was ground (as usual) and the yellow was voltage (as opposed to signal).</p>

<img src="fan.jpg" alt="The computer fan spinning around" style="width: 300px; height:auto;">

<p>However, this still left the enigma of what the blue and green wires did. I suspected that they were signal wires, so I made a quick <a href="fan_test.ino" download>program</a> that would look for data coming out of one of them using <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogRead()</span> and try to send data over the other using <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogWrite()</span>. Since the wires are connected to a circuit board mounted on the motor, the choice is not arbitrary as each wire has a specified purpose.</p>

<img src=fancode.png alt="The test code" style="width: 300px; height:auto;">

<p>I got lucky on the first try and determined that the blue wire was the signal wire and the green was the speed feedback. Now that I know the functions of all of the wires, I could start attempting speed modulation. Below, you can see a video of me changing the speed through the blue signal wire using <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogWrite()</span>. The change in speed isn't particularly noticable, but it is there.</p>

<video height="400px" controls>

</video>

<p>The next step was to mount a potentiometer to the fan in order to be able to control the speed fluidly. The potentiometer also reminds me of the knob-style speed control that the fans in our dorms have. In order to modulate the speed of the fan using the potentiometer, I wired it to the 5V pin, ground, and analog input 1. Then, I fetched the value of the pot (ranging from 1 to 1023) using <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogRead()</span>. The value was then put through the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map()</span> function, converting the 1024 possible values from the analog input to the 256 possible values for the analog output. Finally, the data was sent to the fan through digital output pin 6 (a PWM pin) using <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogWrite()</span>. You can download the code for the potentiometer <a href="fan.ino" download>here</a>.</p>

</video>

<p>You can see in the video that the potentiometer was able to control the speed of the fan quite nicely. Rob later suggested that the potentiometer be directly in series with the fan, which would produce much more noticable effects on the speed but would be harder to control.</p>

<p>Of course, fans need gratings to prevent children from sticking their tiny fingers into the fan blades. I rapidly designed a <a href="models.zip" download>model</a> for the fan casing in Fusion 360. The fan was measured to be 3 inches from mounting point to adjacent mounting point, so the casing was designed to be 4 inches by 4 inches on the front and back faces. The fan's height was measured to be roughly 2.25 inches, so the middle segment of the casing was made to be 2.75 inches to accomodate for the inclusion of circuit elements into the structure. The mounting points themselves were measured to be 0.325 inches at the longest diameter (roughly the size of a 21/64 inch drill bit), so supporting columns were made to the dimension of 0.32 inches in diameter to allow for a tight fit. The grating was vertical bars 5 mm wide in 5 mm offsets.</p>

<img src="model2.png" alt="Model 2" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
</div>

<p>These models suggest that the best way to construct the components is a combination of additive and subtrative measures. However, I chose 3D printing as the way to go due to inexperience with machining wood on the shop bot and also for aesthetic purposes.</p>

<p>The models were sliced using Ultimaker Cura slicing utility. I got a 6 hour 39 minute and 8 hour print time, so I had to do the prints overnight. I checked on the print in progress in the side room at 9:00 PM Tuesday and it was going well, so I slept tight and hoped for the best.</p>

<img src="print.jpg" alt="The print" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

<p>The next morning, I went to the lab early to finish up the initial fan apparatus. The first thing that I did was to check if the pieces fit together well with the fan, as my main concern was that the poles would not fit into the holes and that the poles were not properly lined up with the mounting points on the fan. I found out that the poles were too large for the holes, even though the holes were dimensioned to perfectly fit the poles. In order to remediate this issue, I drilled through the holes again with a 21/64 inch drill bit to widen the holes slightly. Furthermore, the fan's mounting points didn't exactly coincide with the locations of the poles, which meant that I had to widen those holes as well.</p>

<p>Next, I assembled the initial structure by mounting the fan onto the front structure (the one with the poles) through the pre-determined mounting points. I got a really tight fit, so I was satisfied and moved on to finishing up the electronics.</p>

<img src="init.jpg" alt="The initial assembly" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

<p>Initially, all of the circuitry was prototyped on an Arduino Uno. In order to make the fan more compact, I decided to use an Arduino nano for the board in the final product. On Tuesday, I had already prepared a Nano by soldering on the pins for this purpose, so I just had to finish making the connections to the Nano.</p>

<p>I started by clipping off roughly half of the wire that came with the fan (including the ribbon adapter). Then, I twisted together the loose ends for ease of soldering. The wires were soldered to their corresponding pins (Ground to ground, 12V to Vin, speed output to A0, and input to digital output 6). The potentiometer was done in the same fashion.</p>

<img src="solder.jpg" alt="Soldering process" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="solder2.jpg" alt="Soldering done" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>The electronics were now completed, so I mounted the Nano to the stationary part of the fan using hot glue. The pieces were then joined together using hot glue and the potentiometer was mounted onto the top of the back piece using glue as well.</p>

<p>Next, I had to upload my code to the Arduino. These efforts were initially met with failure. I tried to upload and recieved an error, and then I realized my board was set to the Arduino Uno instead of the Nano.</p>

<img src="Uno.png" alt="Initial Board Selection" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="nano.png" alt="Nano Board Selection" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>I changed my board to the Arduino Nano and then tried again, but I got a programmer error (which suggests driver issues that have yet to be resolved):</p>

<img src="fail.png" alt="My failure" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>I tried to change the processor to the ATMega328P Old Bootloader, but this didn't work. I also tried to change the programmer from AVRISP mkII to AVR ISP and ArduinoISP, but this had no effect on the uploading process.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Lana was able to help me out with uploading the program by kindly allowing me to use her computer.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 31)</p>

<div id="3" class="content">

<p>Today was the day when I officially changed my final project idea.</p>

<p>During Wednesday lab on July 31, I worked on getting RF chips to communicate properly, which is key to the remote control aspect of my project. For this project, I chose to use the nRF24 chips in the lab, which have an 8-pin pinout.</p>

<img src="pinout.png" alt="The nRF24 chip pinout" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="arduinopin.png" alt="The corresponding arduino pinout" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>The above images were found online both on Lana's documentation and on Google Images. These came in very helpful when wiring up the RF modules.</p>

<p>In order to incorporate the RF modules into the circuit, I had to take off the gratings to allow access to the circuitry. However, it was at this moment that the structural stress the fan's mounting points overwhelmed the integrity of the 3D-printed material. When I was removing the top piece, one of the poles cracked along the joint with the base. I attempted to fix the issue with superglue, but this proved ineffective when it broke again 10 minutes later.</p>

<img src="glue.jpg" alt="The cyanoacrylate used" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Jonathan had the honestly brilliant idea to fill the empty space in the infill with clay to provide extra surface area for gluing. This was done, and then the piece was placed under weight pressure from a voltmeter to allow for better joining.</p>

<img src="glue1.jpg" alt="The gluing setup" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Now that the basis for the fan's structure was repaired, I could get to work prototyping a rudimentary remote control. I obtained two RF24 chips, two buttons, and some pin/socket wires and got to work on a breadboard.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was make a user interface for my remote using two buttons. I wired two buttons in parallel from 5V to ground with the signal wires running in parallel to ground into pins 2 and 4, and wrote a <a href="remote.ino" download>program</a> that would read from pin 2 using the on-board pull-up resistors. It is important to note that this setup is incorrect, as it results in a 5V to ground short-circuit through the activated button that a pull-up resistor cannot prevent. This prevents other functions from bein executed as it results in a board reset.</p>

<img src="button.jpg" alt="The button circuit" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="code.png" alt="The button code" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<video height="400px" controls>
	<source src="button.MOV" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>However, while testing, everything seemed to work as planned, as the serial monitor kept a consistent output of data. However, when I later held the button for an extended period of time, I discovered that the board turns off, cluing me into a short in the circuit.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I moved on to making the RF chips work. I made extensive use of Lana's documentation on the wiring of the chips. I used the diagrams shown above to wire the RF chips to an Uno and a Nano, following every detail down to the colors (with the exception of white for SCK).</p>

<img src="unorf.jpg" alt="The RF circuit on the Uno" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="nanorf.jpg" alt="The RF circuit on the Nano" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>The remainder of the lab was spent coding. The code was largely based off of <a href="example_radio.zip" download>the example tx/rx code</a>. The code aimed to simply send one of two signals when the corresponding button was pressed, and then the signal would be recieved and printed to the serial monitor by the recieving node.</p>

<p>I wrote the <a href = "radio.ino" download>transmitter code</a> first. I confirmed that this code worked because the program consistently returned failed when the button was pressed, which meant that the code was working properly, but there wasn't a good receiving node to transmit to.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I had no similar success with the receiving node. The <a href="fan_init.ino" download>receiving program</a> would not recieve properly, and it also outputted "strange numbers," which I would later discover to be the output from <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">Serial.println(output)</span>.</p>

<div id="5" class="content">

<p>Today, I made some pretty dramatic progress toward a final product that is presentable. I started today off by transferring the circuitry onto an Arduino Micro board for ease of development (no more uploading errors). First, I had to solder the pin connectors onto the board.</p>

<img src="micro.jpg" alt="The Arduino Micro" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Afterwards, I had to wire the RF chip to the Micro. Unfortunately, the Micro has a different pinout than the Uno and the Nano, so I had to do some Googling to figure out how to do it.</p>

<img src="micro_pinout.png" alt="The Arduino Micro pinout" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="micro_rf.jpg" alt="The Arduino Micro with RF chip attached" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>The rest of the work was done in code. After closely examining the recieving code, I noticed the discrepancies that had caused the code to remain non-functional.</p>

<p>The first issue was that the node names did not correspond with the names specified in the transmitter code. Furthermore, for the down button I was reading the wrong pin. These issues were remediated today by making the address names match and fixing the pin reading issue.</p>

<p>The next step was to implement a way to increment fan speed using the data recieved from the radio transmitter. I did this by using if/else if/else statements to analyze the byte data that was coming in from the radio and increasing/decreasing the speed based off of this input.</p>

<img src="if.png" alt="The if/else code" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>However, I ran into the issue that the fan speed would be infinited incremented because the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">feedback</span> variable would be set to either 0 or 1 forever if there was no other input from the transmitter. To fix this, I reassigned <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">feedback</span> a value of 2 at the end of the loop, which is a number that can neither be sent nor cause any action in the if/else statement.</p>

<p>The program can be downloaded <a href="fan.ino" download>here</a>.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Lab (August 3)</p>

<div id="7" class="content">

<p>Today, I worked on getting the h-bridge working for motor driving in order to make the "moving" part of "moving fan" work.</p>

<p>H-bridges act as bipolar motor drivers, which means that they can drive motors in two directions. This is helpful because it allows for turning and reverse driving.</p>

<p>I started by wiring the power pins of the motor driver to the Arduino Micro, which required me to use a breadboard to split the VCC connection into parallel. I also wired two signal wires to PWM pins 3 and 5 for motor control.</p>

<img src="hwire.jpg" alt="The h-bridge wired up" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Next, I wired a motor to the chip. This required a flathead screwdriver to unscrew the set screws to allow for wire insertion.</p>

<img src="hmotor.jpg" alt="The motor wired to the h-bridge" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Next, I decided to solder my components to a protoboard. I started by soldering the pins on my components to the protoboard.</p>

<img src="protorf.jpg" alt="The protoboard with the RF component soldered" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Next, I soldered colored wires from the RF component to the Arduino. Unfortunately, the colored wires are of the frayed copper type, which makes them difficult to handle with solder. This, combined with a lack of skill, resulted in a mess.</p>

<img src="protorf1.jpg" alt="The protoboard with the RF component soldered and wired" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>The job deteriorated to the point where I will have to redo it, so unfortunately any potential progress in this front was negated.</p>

<p>However, some progress was made in the programming front. I was able to reuse the code for transmitting speed control data for directional control. The program allows for instruction of forward, backward, and left/right turning using a D-pad as the controller.</p>

<img src="dpad.png" alt="The d-pad control code" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p class="collapsible">Labs (August 5 and 6)</p>

<div id="9" class="content">

<p>Today during lab, I redid the soldering job from last time. Although it's not perfect, it looks much better now and is confirmed to have no shorts. By reorienting the RF module and the motor driver to be orthogonal to each other, I was able to find space for the wires to slide through without interfering with the connections to the other component. However, there is still the issue that the connections are hard to read due to how crowded the board is.</p>

<img src="solder1.jpg" alt="The re-done soldering job" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>I also made some substantial programming progress today. The focus of my work was on creating a system to distinguish between the different "intentions" of the data being sent from the RF transmitter. For example, data could be going to the reciever for speed control, but the reciever might understand it as directional control.</p>

<p>My first approach was to create a system of numbers that encoded different actions. In order to do this, I assigned 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as "successful" transmissions, 14 and 15 as "failures" (do nothing), and 11, 12, and 13 as "information types." Therefore, 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 and 5 elicited some form of response from the reciever fan control, and 14 and 15 indicated a lack of action. On the other hand, 11, 12, and 13 signaled which fan subsystem the program was referencing, with 11 being the speed, 12 being the forward/backward control, and 13 being the left/right turning control.</p>

<img src="byteid.png" alt="The information signal" style="height: auto; width:300px;">
<img src="placeholder.png" alt="The code for a placeholder signal" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>I also added a waiting function into the transmitter code in order to prevent the signals from obfuscating one another. The code waits for a response ping from the reciever before continuing the program, which prevents multiple readings from confusing the board.</p>

<img src="wait.png" alt="The wait code" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>However, I had no boards to test with at home, so I was working in the blind. I also wrote another version of the program using only the numbers 0 and 1 to test the hypothesis that the wait/response system effectively eliminated the need for unique numbers for each operation.</p>

<p>You can download both programs <a href = "radiocode_8_06.zip" download>here</a>.</p>

<p>Once I got into the lab, I started testing the program. I initially believed that the lack of function was due to an inability to send numbers greater than 10, but I realized that made no sense since a byte can be 256 unique numbers from 0 to 255. Examinations using some <a href="testcode.zip" download>test code</a> revealed that one of the chips seemed to be incapable of receiving and the other one incapable of sending.</p>



<p>I also used the oscilloscope to detect signals coming from the <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>I</strong>n <strong>S</strong>lave <strong>O</strong>ut (MISO) and <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>O</strong>ut <strong>S</strong>lave <strong>I</strong>n pins (MOSI). I saw regular peaks in the MISO pin on the reciever and a regular signal in the MOSI pin on the transmitter, but they didn't correspond, which suggests a hardware issue with the RF transmitter and reciever chips.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, troubleshooting the code took all of class, so my other progress had to be made outside of class.</p>

<p>In other news, I made some progress toward full directional control using the motor driver. I started by remounting a motor controller to my board using pin/socket wires in the fashion described in the August 3 lab tab. Then, I worked on controlling a motor using the motor driver.</p>

<img src = "motordrive.jpg" alt="The motor driver" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>My first task was to gain two-directional control of the motor using the motor driver. This can be accomplished by hooking the input pins on the driver to digital output pins on the Arduino and setting the voltage to high on one side and low on the other. By reversing the configuration, you can run the motor backward and gain bipolar control. I attached the top of an isopropyl alcohol wipe package for ease of viewing.</p>

<p>The <a href = "motorcode.ino" download>program for this</a> isn't that complicated. It simply sets digital out pin 2 to high and digital out pin 3 to low, waits a second, and then swaps.</p>

<img src="motorcode.png" alt="The motor driver code" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Unfortunately, without the ability to transmit data using the program, I was unable to make any further progress.</p>
