<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 31)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>During lab today, I worked on making a plaster model of Widener library. First, I had to reprint the model that I made of Widener Library (documented <a href="../08">here</a>), which I did overnight.</p>

<p>The first step to making a mold and then casting plaster is to create a container for the mold. I found a little plastic box that I could use for the mold case. In order to conserve the Oomoo, I cut the container down to a size using a box cutter. The final result was slightly taller than the model of the library.</p>

</div>

<p>As you can see in the final image above, the cut I made wasn't very straight and the box was split on one of the faces. This issue was remediated with the use of masking tape to join the two pieces together to prevent spillage of silicone.<p>

<p>Next, I had to prepare the Oomoo mixture. This silicone comes in two parts, Part A (cyan) and Part B (light blue), which are combined in two equal volumes. I measured out roughly half a cup of part B, and then topped off the cup with part A. The silicone took a long time to mix well but it came out with a pretty thick consistency and a light turquoise-cyan color.</p>

<p>Now that the silicone was prepared, it was time to create the mold itself. I placed the positive (the model of the library) into the container and used a piece of clay to cause it to stick to the bottom.</p>

<p>Next, I slowly poured the silicone into the container while tapping the box to force out air bubbles. The silicone came out somewhat rapidly, which is unfortunate because ideally you pour it slowly to prevent air bubbles from folding. I could tell there were air bubbles forming because the silicone folded over itself and incorporated air into the structure. However, I was largely able to force out the air.</p>

<p>Then, I waited for around 2 hours. The cure time of the silicone is 75 minutes, but it took slightly longer to set than the given time.</p>

<p>Upon setting, I had to get the mold out of the container. This was accomplished by separating it from the box edges using a box cutter. However, the tape that I used to join two sides of the box had infiltrated the mold, so that had to be removed.</p>

<p>I planned on casting plaster, so I had to prepare it. I found some old liquidy plaster and decided to thicken it with powder and use that. It took about a half cup of plaster to thicken the plaster to the desired consistency, which was very viscous.</p>

<p>Once I was done with the plaster, I poured it into my mold and let it rest. Initially, I planned on placing the molded back into the box, but unfortunately this was impractical becasue the opening was on the bottom of the mold and not the top. As a result, I had to let the mold rest in the open with no box to make it hold shape.</p>
