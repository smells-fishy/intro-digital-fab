<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 31)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>During lab today, I worked on making a plaster model of Widener library. First, I had to reprint the model that I made of Widener Library (documented <a href="../08">here</a>), which I did overnight.</p>

<p>The first step to making a mold and then casting plaster is to create a container for the mold. I found a little plastic box that I could use for the mold case. In order to conserve the Oomoo, I cut the container down to a size using a box cutter. The final result was slightly taller than the model of the library.</p>

</div>

<p>As you can see in the final image above, the cut I made wasn't very straight and the box was split on one of the faces. This issue was remediated with the use of masking tape to join the two pieces together to prevent spillage of silicone.<p>

<p>Next, I had to prepare the Oomoo mixture. This silicone comes in two parts, Part A (cyan) and Part B (light blue), which are combined in two equal volumes. I measured out roughly half a cup of part B, and then topped off the cup with part A. The silicone took a long time to mix well but it came out with a pretty thick consistency and a light turquoise-cyan color.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that the silicone was prepared, it was time to create the mold itself. I placed the positive (the model of the library) into the container and used a piece of clay to cause it to stick to the bottom.</p>

<p>Next, I slowly poured the silicone into the container while tapping the box to force out air bubbles. The silicone came out somewhat rapidly, which is unfortunate because ideally you pour it slowly to prevent air bubbles from folding. I could tell there were air bubbles forming because the silicone folded over itself and incorporated air into the structure. However, I was largely able to force out the air.</p>

<p>Then, I waited for around 2 hours. The cure time of the silicone is 75 minutes, but it took slightly longer to set than the given time.</p>

<p>Upon setting, I had to get the mold out of the container. This was accomplished by separating it from the box edges using a box cutter. However, the tape that I used to join two sides of the box had infiltrated the mold, so that had to be removed.</p>

<p>I planned on casting plaster, so I had to prepare it. I found some old liquidy plaster and decided to thicken it with powder and use that. It took about a half cup of plaster to thicken the plaster to the desired consistency, which was very viscous.</p>

<p>Once I was done with the plaster, I poured it into my mold and let it rest. Initially, I planned on placing the mold back into the box, but unfortunately this was impractical becasue the opening was on the bottom of the mold and not the top. As a result, I had to let the mold rest in the open with no box to make it hold shape.</p>

<p>The plaster set overnight and it turned out kind of okay. The excess on the top of the mold needs to be removed, and unfortunately the stairs broke while I was extracting the finished product. The pillars were also not present in the final product due to the plaster not being able to infiltrate the small holes.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Final Project Progress</p>

<div id="3" class="content">

<p>This is the first time I have worked on my final project all semester, so we're off to a strong start.</p>

<p>Today, I changed my final project idea from the kinetic sculpture to a fan that follows you around/can be remotely commanded to move. This project will use the fan that I produced last class as a base to build off of.</p>

<p>The first thing that I did was to take off the back piece of the fan to allow for changing of the circuit. Unfortunately, when I did this, one of the poles snapped. Fortunately, Jonathan had the incredible insight to use superglue and clay to fix the structure. The structure is currently sitting in the lab, allowing for the cyanoacrylate glue to set under pressure.</p>

<img src="glue1.jpg" alt="The gluing setup" style="height: auto; width:300px;">

<p>Next, I decided to start working on my remote control for the fan. I grabbed two RF24 chips, some pin-socket wires, and some socket-socket wires and got to work.</p>

<p>The first thing was to develop the user interface for speed control using buttons. I wired up two buttons in parallel from 5V to ground with the signal wires running in parallel to ground to pins 2 and 4, and programmed a script that would read from pin 2. It is important to note that this setup is erroneous, as it results in a 5V to ground short-circuit that a pull-up resistor cannot prevent.</p>

<p>While testing, it was not immediately apparent that anything was wrong. However, when I later held down the button, I noticed that the lights would turn off, indicating a short.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to work well, so I moved on to the RF modules. I made extensive use of Lana's documentation to figure out the pinout of the RF tx/rx chips.</p>

<p>I wired the RF chips to an Arduino Uno and an Arduino Nano using the same colors of wire as shown in the diagram (except using white instead of light green for SCK).</p>

<p>The remainder of class was spent coding. Unfortunately, not much progress was made in this direction, as my code changed relatively little.</p>
