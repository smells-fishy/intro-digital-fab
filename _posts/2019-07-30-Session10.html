<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 31)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>During lab today, I worked on making a plaster model of Widener library. First, I had to reprint the model that I made of Widener Library (documented <a href="../08">here</a>), which I did overnight.</p>

<p>The first step to making a mold and then casting plaster is to create a container for the mold. I found a little plastic box that I could use for the mold case. In order to conserve the Oomoo, I cut the container down to a size that was slightly taller than the model of the library.</p>
