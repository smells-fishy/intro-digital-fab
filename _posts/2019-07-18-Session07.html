<p class="collapsible">Class (July 18)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>Although I usually don't document lectures, Thursday's lecture was a lot of fun and I got to annoy people a lot with a circuit I made, so I think for all future students, this will be a good learning experience on how to get kicked out of the classroom when you do input devices.</p>

<p>This lecture, we investigated sensors. The most interesting sensor to me was the capacitor plates, since I think they have a lot of practical applications. For example, we were able to make sensors for touch using the capacitor plates.</p>

<img src="capsense.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The touch sensor">

<p>However, I had other ideas. I noticed that the serial grapher put out waveforms that reminded me of waveforms commonly seen in music, like square and saw waves. I just felt like I had to investigate the potential of making noise with the output from the touch sensor.</p>

<img src="serial.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The serial graph">

<p>Rob caught me out at a good time and gave a buzzer (I suspect that it's piezoelectric but I'm not sure) and told me about a function called <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone()</span> in the standard Arduino library. Its syntax is <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone(pin, frequency)</span>, where pin is the digital output pin that the buzzer is connected to and frequency is the frequency to output.</p>

<p>I initially tested the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone()</span> function by writing a program to make a buzzer output the relatively pleasant A 440 Hz tone. This was accomplished by wiring the buzzer to pin 9 and ground and writing the line <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone(9, 440)</span>. This experiment proved to be relatively successful, in sense that it worked and that it didn't blow out my eardrums.</p>

</div>

<p>Next, I added the buzzer to the touch sensor circuit, using the 9 and ground pins again. Immediately, the buzzer started outputting the most bizzare noises. When I touched the capacitor, it resulted in painfully high-pitched dog-whistle-like noises.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that the maximum output (which occurs when I touch the capacitor plate) of the touch sensor is well over 300,000, which is far above the hearing limit of a human. The fact that the buzzer still played any audible noise at all suggests that the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone()</span> function has a built-in <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map()</span> function in order to ensure that the buzzer is always output audible noise. Alternatively, the buzzer is mechanically limited to audible noise and therefore wouldn't output noises above the human audible limit in any case.</p>

<p>In any case, this was a really interesting experiment. I would like to further explore the idea of making an instrument with the plates, although that may be difficult with my final project, model of Harvard Yard, and attempt to recreate quantum mechanical experiments on a budget on my plate already.</p>

<p>For reference, my code is available for download <a href="sound.zip" download>here</a>.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Extra Lab! Woah! (July 19)</p>

<div id="3" class="content">

<p>I was so excited to get started with my replication of the "loss of diffraction pattern" experiment that I took an extra lab this week. I came in with the idea to explore how to detect loose electrons from photons colliding with molecules, so I immediately thought capacitor plate and electromagnetic fields.</p>

<p>I started by exploring eletromagnetic field (EMF) sensors. I looked around on the internet and I chanced upon a post on the Arduino Create forum by user justin1445. Although his circuit, program, and project had many flaws, his project was the inspiration for my exploration and therefore inspiration credit should go to him.</p>

<p>This simple EMF sensor required a 330 Ohm resistor, a 100k Ohm resistor, a generic colored LED, and Arduino Uno, and a paperclip. These materials were gathered in the laboratory, and I immediate got to work building the circuit as shown by his schematics.</p>

<img src="emf1.png" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The original circuit">
<img src="emfcode1.png" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The original code">

<p>Shown above is justin1445's original circuit and the corresponding code. All credit for these diagrams goes to him. In essence, this is just an antenna wired in parallel to the analog input pin 0 with an LED that is programmed to activate when a current is induced in the antenna by an electromagnetic field. The <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">constrain()</span> function in conjunction with the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">map()</span> function essentially behaves as an in-code analog-to-digital converter (ADC). However, this code is flawed. The constrain function already limits the analog inputs to being between 1 and 100, which is less than a tenth of the values readable (from 0 to 1023), which renders the intended PWM output to the LED from pin 11 entirely meaningless, as any signal reading above 100 on the analog input will be ingored. I don't really understand the need for this ADC in the code in any case, but it was included by the author of the project anyway.</p>

<p>This circuit ended up only returning 255 with occasional fluctuations. However, the fluctuations indicated there was data being captured, so I got to work changing up the circuit. Initially, I was confused by the circuit's function, but Soumya quickly reminded me that the best way to troubleshoot is just to keep it simple. I took out all of the junk and just wired the antenna in parallel to A0 and ground. I also removed the unnecessary ADC functionality from the code. It was at this point that I realized I was looking at a simple RF reciever. I immedately started getting strange outputs, with values rapidly fluctuating between two dynamic bottom and upper limits. The addition of an averaging function didn't help reduce the noise, so I added a <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">delay(1000/60)</span> (1000/60 correspondes to 1/60th of second) to correspond to a 60 Hz frequency to cause an aliasing effect. As expected, I got a more stretched sinusoidal wave.</p>

<h5>Resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits</h5>

<p>What is an RC circuit and what does it have to do with filters? RC circuits are circuits that have a resistor and a capacitor wired in parallel, and they are best known for their role in frequency filters. RC circuits are characterized by the time it takes for their capacitor to be discharged to the initial voltage divided by e, which is represented by the Greek letter &tau; and equal to resistance times capacitance.</p>

<img src="RCtau.png" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="A graph showing tau vs voltage">
<p>(Image from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>)

<p>As you can see, tau occurs when the capacitor voltage is 63% charged. Alternatively, it is when the capacitor voltage is discharged to 37%.</p>

<p>The principle of the RC time constant &tau; is significant because it plays a large role in the calculations for resistor and capacitor ratings needed to filter certain frequencies.</p>

<h5>Low-pass filters</h5>

<p>Low-pass filters are designed to allow only low-frequency data to be read. The simplest low-pass filter is an RC circuit where the antenna is wired in series to a resistor and in parallel to a grounded capacitor.</p>

<img src="lowsche.png" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="A schematic for a simple RC low-pass filter">
<p>(Image from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>)

<p>This circuit works due to the reactance of the circuit (resistance to change in voltage due to capacitance). Since the low-frequency electromagnetic radiation doesn't switch polarity rapidly, it will be able to slowly charge the capacitor. The capacitor will resist changes in its state (uncharged capacitors tend to stay uncharged), and therefore the low-frequency radiation will be passed to the load, or the analog input in our case. On the other hand, the high frequency radtiation changes polarity rapidly enough that it cannot charge the capacitor and the capacitor will act as a short, leading the high-frequency radiation straight to ground and removing it from the data readings. Another explanation of this phenomenon is that direct current (low frequency EM radiation) doesn't flow well through a capacitor, while alternating current (high frequency EM radiation) does, resulting in a prefered flow to ground for the high-frequency induced current.</p>

<p>It is also possible to determine the maximum frequency the circuit will be able to read. This frequency is defined by one divided by 2 times pi times the RC time constant.</p>

<h5>High-pass filters</h5>

<p>High-pass filters are designed to allow only high-frequency data to be read. The simpled high-pass filter is an RC circuit with the antenna wired in series to the capacitor and in parallel to a resistor. This can be explained in the same manner as above, and the cutoff frequency formula is the same, but instead it represents the minimum frequency the circuit can read.</p>

<p>The remainder of the lab was spent attempting to construct a low-pass filter. I will go into more detail about what filters are later, but the intention was to filter out the high-frequency electronic noise influencing my antenna. If the concept of high and low-pass filters is unfamiliar to you, I strongly suggest clicking on teh button above to learn some more about them before continuing.</p>

<p>I wanted to filter out the high-frequency noise that I suspect was coming from the lights and other electronics in the room. Therefore, I had to make a low-pass filter, which would entail a resistor in series with the antenna and a capacitor in parallel.</p>

<img src="lowpass.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="My schematic for a simple RC low-pass filter">

<p>For my low-pass filter I used a 300 Ohm resistor and a 1 microfarad capacitor. Once the low-pass filter was added, the readings from the antenna flat-lined. After calculating the cut-off frequency of the filter, I realized that the filter was disposing of everything with a frequency higher than 33Hz, which means the only radiation I can currently pick up is super-low frequency radio. Next lab, I'll experiment with making the antenna longer to see if I can't get a stronger reading.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to Soumya for helping me get off the ground and teaching me all about RC circuits and pass filters. You can download my code <a href="antenna.ino" download>here</a>.</p>

<p class="collapsible">Lab (July 22)</p>

<div id="7" class="content">

<p>Today during lab, I refined my antenna. Through various forms of trial and error, I was able to produce two coils that are able to recieve various frequencies at relatively low amplitudes.</p>

<p>At first, I worked toward strengthening the antenna that I had made on Friday. I started by trying to change the RC low-pass filter to allow higher frequencies. I got the highest allowed frequency up to 5 MHz using a 330 Ohm resistor and a 1 pF (picofarad) capacitor, but unfortunately this was past the limits of the wave generators we have on hand in the lab.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I noticed some strange behavior. I was not initially able to replicate the sinusoidal wave I obtained by sampling ambient electric noise at a rate of 60 Hz. However, once I moved to the back of the lab, I was able to recreate that same wave, which suggests that the most likely reason for the initial failure was interference from everybody's Arduino boards running at once.</p>

<img src="initwave.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="My initial results">
<img src="sinwave.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The sine wave recreated">

<p>In the back of the lab, I found the function generators. These were pretty powerful instruments designed to output waves of a certain frequency and altitude. I used the PASCO function generators to test my antenna.</p>

<p>The first thing that I did was test the antenna's capability to pick up a 5 Hz signal. This was accomplished by waving the 5V lead of the signal generator around the antenna while grounding it in parallel to the antenna. Unfortunately, this yielded no results, which lead me to the conclusion that the antenna was not long enough, since antennas should be roughly 1/2 or 1/4 of the wavelength they are intended to capture.</p>

<p>In order to get a longer antenna, I went to the material stockpile and grabbed a metal dowel and vertically clamped to the side of the table I was working on. Then, I wrapped a wire around the pole (ensuring that only the tip of the lead was exposed to prevent any shorts) and wired it to my Arduino. Surprisingly, this did produce some sporadic readings when it was exposed to the 5V lead of the signal generator, but it was an extraordinary weak signal.</p>

<img src="antenna2.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The metal rod antenna">

<p>Rob suggested that I make coils of wires around wooden dowels in order to capture the signals better. This was accomplished by inserting the wooden dowel into the chuck of a hand drill, tightening the chuck around the dowel, and then driving the dowel in order to produce tight coils.</p>

<img src="dontdo.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="Supreme drill technique">

<p>This antenna worked significantly better than the previous two iterations. When the reciever was exposed to a coil trasmitting a signal, it was able to pick it up pretty well. Although the wave was not continuous, you could see the approximation of the wave shape in the readout.</p>

<p>Now that I had a working device, I worked to calibrate it. I decided to calibrate for amplitude because I quickly found my antenna was able to capture a reasonably large range of frequencies. In order to calibrate for amplitude, I moved the amplitude on the function generator and observed the value returned by the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogRead()</span> function. I started by calibrating for the mimimum amplitude my antenna could capture. Curiously, I found nothing displayed at very low amplitudes. In order to find the minimum, I rotated the knob until I got a reading. This was fonud to be 50% of the maximum amplitude the wave function generator could output.</p>

<img src="minmach.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The amplitude setting">

<p>The minimum peak amplitude the antenna can recieve is 0.00977 volts from a raw output of 2.0, calculated by mapping the maximum 5V read of the analog pin to the 1024 possible values and then multiplying by 2.</p>

<p>I also attempted to determine if there was a maximum amplitude the antenna could pick up. However, I just found that the maximum amplitude the machine can output is 12, or 0.0586 V, calculated by mapping the maximum 5V read of the analog pin to the 1024 possible values and then multiplying by 12.</p>

<img src="maxmach.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="The maximum amplitude setting">

<p>Interestingly enough, these antennas filtered out the 60 Hz noise on their own, indicating that the 1 Hz signal output by the function generator was the dominant signal recieved by the antenna. There was no indication of interference with the 60 Hz wave, as regular spikes in the readings came roughly every fifth of a second.</p>

<p>I also investigated the effect o
