<p class="collapsible">Class (July 18)</p>

<div id="1" class="content">

<p>Although I usually don't document lectures, Thursday's lecture was a lot of fun and I got to annoy people a lot with a circuit I made, so I think for all future students, this will be a good learning experience on how to get kicked out of the classroom when you do input devices.</p>

<p>This lecture, we investigated sensors. The most interesting sensor to me was the capacitor plates, since I think they have a lot of practical applications. For example, we were able to make sensors for touch using the capacitor plates.</p>

<p>However, I had other ideas. I noticed that the serial grapher put out waveforms that reminded me of waveforms commonly seen in music, like square and saw waves. I just felt like I had to investigate the potential of making noise with the output from the touch sensor.</p>

<p>Rob caught me out at a good time and gave a buzzer (I suspect that it's piezoelectric but I'm not sure) and told me about a function called <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone()</span> in the standard Arduino library. Its syntax is <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone(pin, frequency)</span>, where pin is the digital output pin that the buzzer is connected to and frequency is the frequency to output.</p>

<p>I initially tested the <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone()</span> function by writing a program to make a buzzer output the relatively pleasant A 440 Hz tone. This was accomplished by wiring the buzzer to pin 9 and ground and writing the line <span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">tone(9, 440)</span>. This experiment proved to be relatively successful, in sense that it worked and that it didn't blow out my eardrums.</p>
