During my first lab, I explored Arduino boards (as well as the Arduino programming language) and protoboard circuitry. At first, I started with a simple circuit to light a red LED using an Arduino board as a power source and a 100 ohm resistor. Initially, the circuit appeared to be dysfunctional, but upon re-examination it was discovered that the LED used was in fact an IR LED, resulting in an output in the non-visible infrared region. Once a red LED was connected, the LED visibly emitted light, indicating that the circuit was functional. I attempted to test the maximum voltage the LED could take by removing the resistor from the circuit, but upon reconnection, the LED burned out.

After exploring circuits, I attempted to manipulate the LED output using the Arduino programming language. Initially, I explored the "Blink" example packaged in the Arduino IDE, which causes an LED to alternate on/off cycles every second. I was able to manipulate the code to cause a single LED to blink ten times a second.

My modified blink code

<p>I continued to experiment with the code, moving on to making multiple lights blink simultaneously. I initially ran into issues involving the
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">delay()</span>
function causing interrupts in the main loop in the Arduino code.</p>

<img src="multiblink_one.png" alt="My initial attempt" style="height: 300px; width:auto; display:block;">

My initial attempt at a program. The code blocks do not run simultaneously.

<p>Attempts to run multiple
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">void loop()</span>
simultaneously failed due to the Uno's single core being incapable of running multiple functions at once. However, after some experimentation and some inspiration from StackExchange and the Arduino Forums, I developed this program:</p>

<img src="multiblink_two_s.png" alt="Code segment 1" style="height: 300px; width:auto; display:block;">

This program allows for multiple functions to run at the same time via calling in the
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">void loop()</span>
. Each LED has its own timeOn variable to track how long it has been on in order to calculate when to switch next. (Note: The significance of the unsigned long variable is that Arduino's
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">millis()</span>function resets after 50 days. An unsigned long integer in Arduino can store 32 bits, or values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. This amount of milliseconds corresponds to 49.7 days.)

The takeaway from this lab is that Arduinos cannot run multiple functions at once, but there are ways around it. Possible improvements in my program would be to create a safeguard against integer overflow. which could potentially cause bugs/malfunctioning.

During Thursday's lecture, we explored the functions of voltmeters and how to use the Arduino board as a voltmeter. First, we used voltmeters to measure the voltage across the circuits we built during Wednesday's lab session. We used voltmeters with bare wire leads to allow for ease of attachment to the circuit.

<img src="voltmeter.jpg" alt="Voltmeter Setup" style="height: 300px; width:auto; display:block;">

Notice that the voltmeter is attached to the circuit in parallel, and that the voltage was measured directly across the LED. This setup yields the forward voltage drop of the LED. However, it must be noted that voltage drops measured from the LED cannot be used for circuit analysis via Ohm's Law, as LEDs do not obey Ohm's Law (LEDs have an exponential relationship between voltage and current). If analysis of the circuit is desired, then the voltage drop must be measured across the resistor in the circuit.

Next, we examined the usage of the Arduino board as a voltmeter. Using the
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">analogRead()</span>
command, Arduino can read voltages through the "analog" pins on the board. All that is required is to change the circuit such that the ground wire goes into any one of the analog input slots.

As you can see, the program reads the signal from the Arduino analog pin and then displays it onto the console using the
<span markdown="1" style="background-color: lightgray; font-family:Courier New;">Serial.begin() and Serial.prinln()</span>
commands. The signal value can be converted into voltage by multiplying by 5 (5V is the maximum) and dividing by 1023 (1024-1, the maximum values the analog pin can read).

For my first project, I'm going to be making a two-piece robotic arm. I won't be adding a hand or claw, although I might do that in my own time. The first step for me was to plan the circuit.

<img src="servosketch_jpg.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: block;" alt="Servo sketch">

This circuit aims to control the position of two servos using the signal output of two potentiometers. In the above diagram, this is represented by the yello wires, going into the analongIn pins and exiting through the digitalOut pins.
