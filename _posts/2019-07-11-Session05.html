<p>For my programmable electronics assignment, I made a circuit that causes a yellow LED to fade over a period of 10 seconds when a button is pressed.</p>
<p>This was accomplished using an Arduino board and a protoboard. First, I planned my circuit. Shown below is a Fritzing-made schematic for the circuit.</p>

<p>I assembled the circuit using the same colored wires and using a protoboard to facilitate connections. I initially ran into issues with the button value randomly reading "pressed" when in reality it was not pressed, but this was resolved rapidly by replacing the component.</p>
<p>However, I also wired the circuit improperly. I accidentally wired the button straight to digital pin 2 (instead of the 5V) with no external resistor, which caused the circuit to malfunction when pin 2 was set to INPUT, but not when the pin was set to OUTPUT. After finding out about this, I took apart the circuit and rebuilt it properly. Below, you can find a video of the circuit working and an image.</p>

<p>The code for the program was the last thing to finish. The code uses an if/else statement to test for the button's status and a for loop to fade the LED in a step-wise fashion. Below is an image of the code.</p>
